# ðŸ“§ Spam Mail Prediction Using Python

This project is a **machine learning model** that predicts whether an email is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Python, scikit-learn, and TF-IDF Vectorization**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Email spam is one of the most common problems in communication systems.  
This project demonstrates how to train a **Logistic Regression** classifier to filter spam emails effectively.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on custom input.
